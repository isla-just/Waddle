<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![image1][image1]

### Project Description

An iOS application that helps kids manage their monthly pocket money spending. Parents are able to set up their account with a parental pin and set their pocket money. Then kids can log the spending of their pocket money on the app and it is reflected on their Big Bucks card. They can even use the in-app calculator to see if they will have enough Big Bucks for their next purchase. This teaches kids how to manage their money effectively throughout the month - a very valuable skill

### Built With

* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

### Initial designs

### User-flow

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process


The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

#### Onboarding sequence
I started by setting up my project and my Github and then started following a tutorial I found on the liquid onboarding sequence

#### Frontend development
Then I focussed on implementing my designs using SwiftUI. I spent some time learning about layouts, grids and UI elements available on the platform

#### Navigation
After realising how simple it is to navigate to pages and understanding how Swift navigation bars and tabs work, I was able to implement them in my project.

#### Mapping and filtering
Next, I focussed on how I was going to structure my data. I then mapped it on the frontend and implemented the searching and filtering functionality

#### App storage 
Lastly, I did the settings page and set up the alternative appearance of my app. I implemented data storage for light mode and dark mode and on the onboarding screenality

### Highlights

* I really enjoyed how simple it is to create really beautiful frontends using SwiftUI. I also really enjoyed setting up the alternative appearance of my app and seeing everything come together. I also loved the concept ideation for this project

#### Challenges

* Initially I struggled with layouts and grids but after getting the hang of it it was super easy. I also struggled coming up with an initial idea that fit the brief but I am so happy with the one that I chose.


#### Future Implementation

* Actually adding a new spend in the future
* adding charts and graphs to visualise changes
* a piggy bank feature to put money aside
